        <p>Tech has always been used in Business even in small businesses such as corner stores, delis, bodegas, etc. I live in NYC and I visit my local deli almost everyday for food and necessities that I need and a thing that has always been used would be a cash register and they recently added some changes to make it more modern such as a squarestand where it makes it more easier for them to take my order and accept a wider variety of payment options cash,card,apple pay so they can get more customers. It took a little while to get used to but it's more easier for me and the person at the counter so they can take my order quicker and have it done it more time efficient for me. Furthermore I also resell sneakers and a place that I go in Soho is where I drop off my sneakers which is a place called Stockx. They use these scanners to make sure my item has arrived at the location and is going to be inspected and processed. They also use notifications to update the customer of when the item is finished being authenticated and cash goes into my account which is very convenient for me.

        <p>Tech has always been used in business such as the stock market for example according to the article finance.zacks.com the internet shows if  certain stock is increasing  or decreasing  and the amount that it increased or decreased so you can just pick up your phone and check your stocks which is very convenient. Also tech shows the records of the stock such as an inventory Control System which shows the record of your stock times when it increased and decreased. phones and computers are forms of business because you can communicate via email,call,text and be able to monitor different things such as software engineers are on computers developing software solutions for things like apps,websites, and different types of applications to make sure it runs smoothly  according to coding nomads.co. Phones and computers are just out of this world to be accessing different sources of information on different websites you can learn a lot from the web on internet and phones especially on youtube and you could find ways to make money like bitcoin which is a type of stock , reselling sneakers using different types of apps to cop and resell sneakers, and things like doordash which can bring food right to your home and you can pay through your phone. All these things are connected to tech in a way.
